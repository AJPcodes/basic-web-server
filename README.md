# Node-web-server
This project started out as a very basic webserver, and ended up being practice for a number of topics thematically unrelated but all dealing with serverside code. It now serves as a one-stop shop for examples of Node core concepts. 

This project included practice with the following:
Using query and route parameters, web scraping, parsing forms using HTTP, creating REST apis, deploying projects to Heroku.
